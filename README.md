# stock-data-visualization
In this project, I used the 'yfinance' python library and web scraping method to extract the revenue data for Tesla and GameStop and build a dashboard to compare the stock price vs the revenue. 

(Due to some issues with github the plots aren't visible here, to view the plots you can download the file and run on your system.)
